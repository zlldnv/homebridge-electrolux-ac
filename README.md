##

U should active MiLearn from Home app then try to learn each command manually.  
At the meantime, you are supposed to see the command string come out in the HomeBridge console.  
Just like:  
[10/27/2017, 2:39:35 AM][miirplatform] [MiIRRemote][irlearn]Learned Code: Z6WDAC8CAAAIBQAAAggAALsiAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjAAAAAAAQABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAQAAAAEAAAABAAAAAQEAAAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAEBAQAAA=  
Just grab the string then fill it to config file, everything should be working after u restart HomeBridge.

### Custom is used for multi-commands. when you want to add a lot of commands in one switch, just use custom. Custom's data is just like a switch.add your commands in on/off like the sample-config. Just like:

"0": "interval|code"

- Because of the limit of JSON, you have to add "number" as the key of the data.Use it just as the sample below.
- interval means the time to send the command after you press the on/off switch.Use 0 to send immediately.
- interval's unit is second. you can use number like 0.5 if you want to send commands within a second.(I don't suggest you set too much commands in a short time.)

### MomentarySwitch is a switch which will automaticly turn off after you turn on it (0.3s). It is used for some situation like you want to launch a channel on button.

Open command prompt or terminal. Run following command:

```

"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" is token.  
If token is "???", then reset device and connect device created Wi-Fi hotspot.
